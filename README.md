# Human-Activity-Recognition
## Objective

In this project will try to predicts the human activity such as (1-Walking, 2-Walking upstairs, 3-Walking downstairs, 4-Sitting, 5-Standing or 6-Laying). This data collected by the sensors which embedded in smartphone to detect the human activities and sensors were used to collect data from 30 different people performing a set of activities. But the accuracy of prediction though is questionable. Thus, a multi classification model that could determine the accuracy of this prediction.

## Dataset

A single Dataset splitted into 5 parts of Dataset (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, features) downloaded from analyticsvidhya used in this project. Link to access the datasets - https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/24-ultimate-data-science-projects-to-boost-your-knowledge-and-skills/

A datasets has 10,299 rows, there are 561 different variables and one target variable that holds the activity performed.
